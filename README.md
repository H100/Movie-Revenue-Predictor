# Movie-Revenue-Predictor
We are making an app for predicting imdb rating for a new movie before its release. This app can be used by movie producers to choose directors, actors, etc. for their coming movies based on the prediction by the app.

We will be prediciting the rating by following two approaches :
1.) Clasification 2.) Regression

In classification apporach, we assume the rating to be a discrete variable that can take 101 values from the set {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, .. 1.1, 1.2, .. , 2.1, 2.2, .. ,9.8, 9.9, 10.0}. [Classification algorithms used will be updated as soon as it is implemented].
  In regression approach, we assume the movie rating to be a continuous variable taking values from [0,10] with precision upto one decimal point. [Regression algorithms used will be updated as soon as it is implemented].
